# Record Of Survival In Digital Totalitarian Era

*Record Of Survival In Digital Totalitarian Era* consists of Luterngun, an amateur Chinese digital rights advocate's study notes and practical experience in cencorship circumvention, cybersecurity and online anonymity since 2017.

Meanwile, it also serves as a personal answer to the question of what an individual can do to counter Chinese digital leviathan, an amateurish/popular science reader pertaining to digital resistance, which is expected to help those non-tech-savvy-users live a freer and safer digital life.

“reconsidera” (reconsider+a), the name of this repo, is adapted from the acronym for “Record Of Survival In Digital Totalitarian Era”.
